            <h2 id="The current focus">The current focus</h2>

            <p>The Georgia Senate Runoff will be held on January 5th and both senate seats are in play. Just like the Nov 3rd election, voting in person on election day, early in person voting, or vote by mail are all options. The registration deadline for anybody not already registered is December 7th. The candidates are Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. Below are some excerpts from their sites and links to their bios and policy platforms in full.</p>

            <h3 id="Meet Jon">Meet Jon</h3>

            <p>Jon Ossoff is a Georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small business owner.</p>

            <p>Jon is fighting for great health care for every American with a strong Public Option and strengthened Affordable Care Act, to defend Medicare and Social Security, for historic investment in clean energy and infrastructure, to lower taxes for working families and small businesses, to defend Roe v. Wade and the privacy of women’s health care, to enact major criminal justice reform, to get dark money out of politics and end Citizens United.</p>

            <h3 id="Meet Rpahael">Meet Raphael</h3>

            <p>Reverend Raphael Warnock grew up in Kayton Homes public housing in Savannah. The family was short on money, but long on faith, love and humor. Raphael and his eleven brothers and sisters were taught the meaning of hard work.</p>

            <p>As Senator, Reverend Warnock will bring to Washington the concerns of struggling Georgia families who wonder why no one is looking out for them. He will focus on fighting for quality, affordable health care, for the dignity of working people who are paid too little as our government works more for Wall Street, and to make sure every voice is heard.</p>

            <h2 id="The stakes">The stakes</h2>

            <p>The delta between the representation Ossoff and Warncok offer and that of the current Republican incumbents cannot be overstated, and the resulting stakes for Georgians are immense. This is a race between issue focused progressives and Trumpian Republicans—people who have pitched themselves as being "More conservative than Attila the Hun" (as Loeffler did in an ad) or simply played along with the party line of pretending to be for protecting preexisting conditions while continually sabotaging the Affordable Care Act.</p>

            <p>On a national level these runoffs will determine which party has majority control in the 117th Congress. That majority is critical for our ability to sidestep any attempt at obstruction from Senate Republicans. Critical for passing bold action to combat climate change and invest in renewable energy, granting statehood to Puerto Rico and DC, getting affordable healthcare to all those who don't have it today, and virtually every other issue in the Democratic platform.</p>

            <h2 id="How volunteering helps">How volunteering helps</h2>

            <p>Communication from campaign volunteers directly to voters boosts turnout. Field experiments run by the American Politics Research Journal have shown increased turnout as high as 3.8 percentage points as a result of phone banking efforts. Margins in districts and states as a whole is often a lot less than that. These efforts can genuinely make the difference. We flipped Georgia to beat Trump and that shows us that the votes are there to win these Senate runoffs too. We just need to turn them out.</p>


            <h2 id="What you can do">What you can do</h2>
            <h3 id="Phone Banking">Phone Banking</h2>

            <p>Currently the Warnock and Ossoff campaigns are requesting all the phone bankers they can get. In their estimation this is the single most effective way for us to make sure we get the kind of turnout we need. Text banking opportunities might crop up, but we're focusing on phone calls for the moment.</p>

            <h3 id="Phone Banking">Post Cards</h2>
            <p>If you can't phone bank—or simply want to do more on top of phone banking—take a look at the Georgia Postcard Project, a grassroots effort to turn out the vote via postcard mailing campaigns. An important element of this is getting resources like the Georgia Voter Protection Hotline in front of folks.</p>

            <p>If you're in the financial position to be able to donate, whether to the campaigns, the likes of the Postcard Project, or to Stacey Abrams' Voter Protection organization Fair Fight, every dollar helps!</p>
